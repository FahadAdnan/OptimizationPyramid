# OptimizationPyramid
A windows form app made using c# on visual studios utilizing multiple libraries such as drawing and data visualization. 
Shows optimization for the volume of a square based pyramid with the constraint being surface area, where both surface area and side length of the square base can be adjusted. 

Created to showcase my knowledge in derivatives and to teach help aid younger students in learning the concepts of derivatives applications in real life.
